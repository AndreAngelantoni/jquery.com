Meetups are a great way to meet other community members, expand your knowledge,
socialize, and show off what you've been working on.

Thousands of developers get together every month all over the world to share
their knowledge. Check out meetup.com to find a
[jQuery or JavaScript related meetup](https://www.meetup.com/find/)
