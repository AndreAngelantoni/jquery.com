Meetups are a great way to meet other community members, expand your knowledge,
socialize, and show off what you've been working on.

Thousands of developers get together every month all over the world to share
their knowledge. Check out meetup.com to find a [jQuery](http://jquery.meetup.com/)
or [JavaScript](http://javascript.meetup.com/) meetup near you. Can't find a
meetup near you? Consider [creating your own meetup](http://www.meetup.com/create/)!

Looking for larger events? We have plenty of
[trainings and conferences](http://events.jquery.org/) all over the world too!
