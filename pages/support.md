## Version Support Status

We support only the latest version of jQuery. The 1.x and 2.x branches are no longer supported.

jQuery 3 is the current version of jQuery and version 4 is currently in beta. When 4 releases, we will provide fixes and patches for some time before moving version 3 to End of Life.

#### Still on Version 1 or 2? Here are your options:

1. Upgrade to a supported version of jQuery. If possible, the best solution is to upgrade to the supported version of jQuery as this keeps you safe and gives you the best performance and features. If considering a migration, jQuery Migrate is a good resource to explore: [https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate).

1. If you cannot migrate, but require a secure version of jQuery, you can obtain [commercial security support](#commercial-support) for your applications to keep them secure.

1. Otherwise, if your application has no security requirements, then you can stay on one of the unsupported versions of jQuery, but be aware that this comes with multiple risks.
